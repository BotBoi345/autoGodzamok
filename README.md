# autoGodzamok
### Cookie Clicker addon for automating Godzamok. <br> Inspired by [rad-attraction's Buttegodzamok](https://github.com/Rad-Attraction/butte_godzamok) <br>
#### Activates Godzamok when Click frenzy, Elder frenzy, or Building Specials are active <br> Sells all cursors, farms, mines, factories, and banks and buys all of them. <br> Recommended to decrease the amount of these buildings to reduce cookies lost by rebuying.
 
Note: for now it only sells farms...
