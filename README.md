# autoGodzamok <br>
## Inspired by [rad-attraction's Buttegodzamok](https://github.com/Rad-Attraction/butte_godzamok) <br>
### Cookie Clicker addon for automating Godzamok. <br> Activates Godzamok when Click frenzy, Elder frenzy, Building Specials are active <br>  Sells all cursors, farms, mines, factories and buys all of them. 
 
 ~~Has an unfortunate side effect of leaving you on 'Buy 100' after activating Godzamok <br> (please i "borrowed" this code and dont know how it works i cant fix it)~~ nvm fixed it.
